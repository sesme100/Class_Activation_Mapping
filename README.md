# Class_Activation_Mapping
Class Activation Mapping using VGG for Weakly Supervised Learning 
It describes the procedure for generating class activation maps(CAM) using global average pooling(GAP) in CNNs. A class activation map for a particular category indicates the discriminative image regions used by the CNN to identify that category.

To check the influences with Global Average Pooling(GAP) vs. Gloabl Max Pooling(GMP)
